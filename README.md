## Description
This is a blog project that aims to be free of dependencies. To achieve this, browser native Web Components are used.

While this project does not have any NPM packages, there are a couple of VS Code extensions that makes life easier:
* es6-string-html: Provides syntax highlighting in string literals
* quick-lint-js: Plugin based linter that works out of the box with no configuration
